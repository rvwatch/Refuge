# Refuge

I created Refuge as a tool to help those who suffer from high anxiety and panic attacks. It taps into the Fitbit api to help users view times when they were likely to have experienced stimulus that may have triggered a panic attack. It also provides users breathing exercises, guided meditations and playlists to help bring down the intensity of a panic attack. Users can also reach out to a support number if they're having a particularly tough time.

### Motivation

Having suffered from PTSD triggered panic attacks, this project carries a deep personal motivation for me. I discovered strategies to capture a stimulus or thought before it might send me spiraling into a panic attack. I'm hoping to provide users with the tools and insights to discover similar stimulus that might cause an attack. Once you can recognize the causes, you stand a chance at preventing them.
